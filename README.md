## What is GitHub Copilot?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Copilot can transform the developer experience by providing contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the code editor to code explanations and docs queries on GitHub.com. 

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise are designed for organizations and enterprises. All offerings include code completion and chat assistance, but they differ in terms of license management, policy management, and IP indemnity, as well as how data may be used or collected.

GitHub Copilot Individual features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment‚Äîthat is, the code editor and command line.

GitHub Copilot Business includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Individual, adding on organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity. In early-2024, both will include GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. 

GitHub Copilot Enterprise integrates GitHub Copilot into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse about their codebase, and as action buttons throughout the platform, adding an additional layer of personalization by indexing your codebase to get a deeper understanding and create more tailored suggestions. Soon, it will be able to fine-tune custom, private models for code completion.
